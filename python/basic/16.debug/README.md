# Python Basics - Debugging

Chapter 20 explores the critical skill of debugging in Python, providing strategies and tools for identifying and fixing errors in code. This chapter categorizes errors and offers practical advice on how to approach and resolve them effectively. Below is a summary of the key concepts covered in Chapter 20.

---

## 1. Syntax Errors

Syntax errors occur when the structure of the code is incorrect. The Python interpreter detects these errors during the translation of source code into byte code.

### Example:

```python
if True print("Hello, World!")
```

### Use Cases:

- Detecting and fixing common syntax mistakes like missing colons, mismatched parentheses, or incorrect indentation.
- Ensuring code adheres to Python's syntax rules.

---

## 2. Runtime Errors

Runtime errors occur while the program is running. These errors include issues like infinite loops, recursion depth exceeded, or accessing undefined variables.

### Example Code:

```python
def recursive_function():
    return recursive_function()

recursive_function()
```

### Use Cases:

- Identifying and resolving issues that only appear when the code is executed.
- Debugging loops, recursion, and other dynamic code behaviors.

---

## 3. Semantic Errors

Semantic errors are logical errors where the code runs without producing error messages but does not perform the intended task.

### Example:

```python
result = 5 + "10"  # Results in a TypeError, rather than performing intended operation
```

### Use Cases:

- Ensuring that the code logic matches the expected behavior.
- Troubleshooting unexpected outcomes or incorrect results.

---

## 4. Debugging Techniques

The chapter provides several strategies for debugging, such as simplifying the problem, cleaning up the code, and using print statements effectively.

### Example Code:

```python
x = 10
print(f"x is: {x}")
```

### Use Cases:

- Using print statements to trace the flow of execution and the state of variables.
- Simplifying code to isolate the source of errors.

---

### Summary:

Chapter 20 emphasizes the importance of understanding different types of errors and offers practical methods for diagnosing and fixing them. By applying these techniques, programmers can improve their debugging skills and write more reliable code.
