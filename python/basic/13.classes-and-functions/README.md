# Python Basics - Classes and Functions

This chapter expands on object-oriented programming by exploring how classes and functions interact in Python. It covers essential concepts like creating functions that work with programmer-defined objects, pure functions, and modifiers. Below is a summary of the key concepts covered in Chapter 16.

## 1. Time Class

The chapter begins by introducing a new programmer-defined type, `Time`, which records the time of day. The class includes attributes for hours, minutes, and seconds.

### Example Code:

```python
class Time:
    # Represents the time of day.
    def __init__(self, hour=0, minute=0, second=0):
        self.hour = hour
        self.minute = minute
        self.second = second
```

### Use Cases:

- Modeling and manipulating time-based data.
- Performing arithmetic on time values.

## 2. Pure Functions

Pure functions do not modify any of the objects passed to them as arguments. Instead, they return a new object, making them side-effect-free and easy to reason about.

### Example Code:

```python
def add_time(t1, t2):
    sum = Time()
    sum.hour = t1.hour + t2.hour
    sum.minute = t1.minute + t2.minute
    sum.second = t1.second + t2.second
    return sum
```

### Use Cases:

- Creating functions that are predictable and easy to test.
- Avoiding unintended side effects in function operations.

## 3. Modifiers

Modifiers are functions that alter the objects they receive as arguments. Unlike pure functions, modifiers change the state of existing objects.

### Example Code:

```python
def increment(time, seconds):
    time.second += seconds
    while time.second >= 60:
        time.second -= 60
        time.minute += 1
    while time.minute >= 60:
        time.minute -= 60
        time.hour += 1
```

### Use Cases:

- Efficiently updating the state of an object.
- Implementing time-based operations directly on `Time` objects.

## 4. Prototyping vs. Planning

The chapter also discusses two approaches to program development: prototyping and planning. Prototyping involves quickly writing code to explore an idea, while planning involves designing a solution before coding.

### Example Code:

Prototyping does not have specific example code, but the concept is about starting with a simple version and refining it as you go.

### Use Cases:

- Rapid development of ideas.
- Gradual improvement of code through iterations.

---

### Summary:

Chapter 16 enhances the understanding of object-oriented programming by teaching how to create and manipulate programmer-defined objects using functions. It introduces important concepts like pure functions and modifiers, which are crucial for writing clean and maintainable code.
