# Chapter 7: Final Thoughts

Chapter 7 of "REST API Design Rulebook" takes a step back to evaluate the current state of REST API development and offers concluding thoughts on what needs to improve for REST APIs to become more user-friendly and powerful.

## Key Points:

### The State of the Art:

The chapter acknowledges that REST API development tools and frameworks have room for improvement. Inconsistency in design and limited tooling are common challenges.

### The Importance of Uniformity:

There's a strong emphasis on the need for consistent design and development practices in REST APIs. This would make them easier to build, maintain, and integrate with other APIs.

### The Power of GUI Tools:

GUI (graphical user interface) tools can significantly simplify the REST API design process, making it faster and more efficient.

### Design Over Code:

The author advocates for focusing on design and configuration rather than writing code for REST APIs. This allows developers to spend more time on core business logic and less time on API-specific details.

### Leveraging Tools and Frameworks:

Utilizing suitable tools and frameworks can streamline the development process for REST APIs, making them more efficient.

## Conclusion:

- REST API development currently faces certain challenges.
- There's a need for greater consistency in REST API design and development practices to improve their effectiveness.
- GUI tools can significantly improve the design process, making it easier and more efficient.
- Design and configuration should be prioritized over coding in REST API development.
- Employing suitable tools and frameworks will enhance the efficiency of REST API development.
