# Chapter 6: Client Concerns

This chapter focuses on ensuring that your REST API effectively caters to the needs of its clients, who will be directly interacting with the API. It covers key topics such as:

## 1. Versioning:

### The Problem:

As REST APIs evolve, they often need to change to add new features, fix bugs, or improve performance. These changes can lead to incompatibility between different API versions.

### Solutions:

- **New URIs for New Concepts**:  
  Instead of modifying existing URIs, introduce new URIs to represent new features or concepts.

  **Example**:  
  A REST API for a to-do list application might initially use `/todos` to manage tasks. When the API is upgraded to support "draft" and "published" states for tasks, a new URI `/todos/v2` could be introduced for the new version of the API, while `/todos` would refer to the older version.

- **Schemas for Versioned Representations**:  
  Manage different versions of resource representations using schemas.

  **Example**:  
  When a to-do list API is updated, the schema for the "task" resource might be updated to include a new status field (e.g., draft, published). The new schema could be stored under a new URI, such as `http://api.schemas.example.com/task-v2`, to differentiate it from the older schema.

- **Entity Tags (ETags) for State Management**:  
  Use ETags to manage different versions of resource states.

  **Example**:  
  Whenever the state of a task changes (e.g., from "draft" to "published"), its ETag would be updated. Clients can use ETags to determine if the version of the resource they have is the latest.

## 2. Security:

### The Problem:

REST APIs often need to protect resources from unauthorized access.

### Solutions:

- **OAuth (Open Authorization)**:  
  A widely adopted open standard for secure authorization. OAuth allows users to share their resources (e.g., personal information on social media) with other applications without revealing their passwords.

- **API Management Solutions**:  
  These solutions provide various security features for APIs, such as:

  - **Authentication**: Verifying user identities.
  - **Authorization**: Controlling user access to resources.
  - **Data Security**: Encrypting data transmitted between the client and the API.

## 3. Handling Requests from JavaScript Browsers:

### The Problem:

JavaScript browsers enforce the "same origin policy," limiting JavaScript code from accessing resources from different domains.

### Solutions:

- **JSONP (JSON with Padding)**:  
  This technique allows JavaScript code to access data from different domains by combining JSON with a JavaScript function defined on the client's website.

- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**:  
  A W3C standard that provides a more secure alternative to JSONP for cross-domain access. CORS allows servers to explicitly declare which domains are permitted to access their resources.

## 4. Creating Client-Friendly Responses (Response Representation Composition):

### The Problem:

Clients may need to retrieve only a portion of a resource's data, especially when dealing with large datasets.

### Solutions:

- **Filtering and Pagination Using Query Parameters**:  
  Clients can use query parameters (e.g., `?completed=false&pageStartIndex=10&pageSize=5`) to filter and paginate results, reducing the amount of data transferred.

- **Including Linked Resources in Responses**:  
  The API can include links to related resources within the response. For example, a response for a to-do list might include a link to a "create new task" resource.
