# Chapter 1: Introduction - REST API Design Rulebook

This chapter introduces RESTful web services by exploring the evolution of the World Wide Web and its core architectural constraints. It aims to lay the groundwork for the detailed design rules and principles that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.

## Key Concepts:

### The Origin of the World Wide Web:

- The chapter traces the Web's roots to CERN, where Tim Berners-Lee created the initial web server, browser, and HTML editor.
- It highlights the rapid growth of the Web and the scalability challenges that emerged, prompting the need for a new architectural style.

### The Architectural Style of the Web:

- The chapter explains Roy Fielding's identification of six key architectural constraints that define the Web's design:

  1. **Client-server**: Clear separation of responsibilities between clients and servers.
  2. **Uniform interface**: Consistent interaction rules for interoperability.
  3. **Layered system**: Intermediaries can be added without disrupting communication.
  4. **Caching**: Data caching for performance optimization and reduced server load.
  5. **Stateless**: Each request is treated independently, without relying on server-side state.
  6. **Code-on-demand**: Clients can download executable code (e.g., JavaScript) from the server.

- These constraints are essential for building a scalable and reliable Web.

### REST (Representational State Transfer):

- REST, a term coined by Fielding, describes the Web's architectural style based on these six constraints.
- REST emphasizes the use of resources, representations, and hypermedia as core elements in web communication.

  - **Resources**: Represent concepts like documents, collections, or individual items.
  - **Representations**: Different ways to present a resource (e.g., HTML or JSON).
  - **Hypermedia**: Links within representations to guide clients towards related actions and resources, enabling "state-sensitive navigation."

### RESTful Web APIs:

- The chapter explains how REST principles are applied to the design of Web APIs.
- RESTful APIs leverage the benefits of REST's architecture, resulting in well-structured, scalable, and interoperable services.

### WRML (Web Resource Modeling Language):

- The chapter introduces WRML, a conceptual framework created by the author to simplify REST API design.
- WRML provides guidelines and tools for modeling resources, representations, and hypermedia, improving REST API design and implementation.
